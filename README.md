# Hidester Proxy VS Hidester VPN
Comparing Hidester Proxy and Hidester VPN depends on your specific needs. Proxies don't necessitate any software installation, whereas VPNs typically do. However, proxies have some significant drawbacks:

The proxy only transmits data through your browser. In contrast, a VPN protects 100% of internet traffic, including traffic via peer-to-peer apps and gaming messaging apps.

The data exchanged between your computer and the websites is not encrypted. If it's not encrypted, hackers and ISPs can capture and analyze the data with their tools.
